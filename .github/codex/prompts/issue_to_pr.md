You are working in the repository a-s-patel/github.io, which powers https://www.proofoverhype.click/.

RULES:
- Do EXACTLY ONE task per run.
- The task is described in the GitHub Issue title and body.
- Implement the changes directly in the repo files.
- Use folder-based URLs: /section/index.html → /section/
- Use root-relative links everywhere (href="/playbooks/") so custom domain works.
- Add/keep a shared header/nav across homepage + all section pages.
- Match homepage H1 + subheadline styling; subheadline should be italic where applicable.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness: no horizontal scroll, readable typography.
- Do not add new frameworks unless explicitly required.

OUTPUT:
- Make the code changes.
- Leave the repository in a state ready to commit (clean working tree after changes are committed by the workflow).
